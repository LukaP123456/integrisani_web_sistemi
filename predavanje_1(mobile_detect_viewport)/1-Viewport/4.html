    Not all devices are the same width; you should make sure that your pages work well in a large variation of screen
    sizes and orientations.

    The basic properties of the "viewport" <meta> tag include:

    width:

    Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the special
    value device-width, which is 100vw, or 100% of the viewport width. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

    height:

    Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like height=400 or to the special
    value device-height, which is 100vh, or 100% of the viewport height. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

    initial-scale:

    Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default:1. Negative values: ignored.

    minimum-scale:

    Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. Negative values: ignored.

    maximum-scale:

    Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. Any value less than 3 fails accessibility.
    Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default:10. Negative values: ignored.

    user-scalable:

    Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page. Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no. Default: 1,
    which is the same as yes. Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

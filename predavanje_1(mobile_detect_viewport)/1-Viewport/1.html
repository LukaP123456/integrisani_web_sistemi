    The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

    The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

    Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

    Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to
    fit the viewport.

    To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,height=device-height, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">

    Not all devices are the same width; you should make sure that your pages work well in a large variation of screen
    sizes and orientations.

    The basic properties of the "viewport" <meta> tag include:

    width:

    Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the special
    value device-width, which is 100vw, or 100% of the viewport width. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

    height:

    Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like height=400 or to the special
    value device-height, which is 100vh, or 100% of the viewport height. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

    initial-scale:

    Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default:1. Negative values: ignored.

    minimum-scale:

    Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. Negative values: ignored.

    maximum-scale:

    Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. Any value less than 3 fails accessibility.
    Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default:10. Negative values: ignored.

    user-scalable:

    Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page. Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no. Default: 1,
    which is the same as yes. Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
